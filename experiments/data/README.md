# Scripts to Preprocess Datasets for Evaluation

This folder contains scripts for preprocessing datasets for all of our benchmarking (both automatic and interactive segmentation)

> TLDR: The idea of this scripts are to use the input images corresponding to how they should be on a practical point of view. You can write your own scripts / provide path to your images in our [example scripts](../../examples/).
