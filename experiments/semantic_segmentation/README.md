# Scripts for Training and Evaluating Semantic Segmentation using PathoSAM

This folder contains scripts for training a semantic segmentation model, starting from `patho-sam` generalist models. Here is a brief mention of the folders:
- `benchmarking`: Contains scripts to run BioMedParse for semantic segmentation in histopathology images and scripts to evaluate other benchmark methods for the task.
- `generalists`: Contains scripts to run the training and evaluation of semantic segmentation (in all combinations) from `patho-sam` generalist models. 
- `results`: Contains scripts for plotting the results for semantic segmentation.
